# PyPsi - PSI Theory Implementation in Python

A modern Python port of Dietrich Dörner's PSI cognitive architecture.

## Overview

PSI (Ψ) is a unified theory of cognition, emotion, and motivation that explains complex behavior through simple, interacting mechanisms. This implementation brings the original 2003 Delphi codebase to modern Python with a Kivy-based GUI.
