# Joscha Bach & MicroPsi/PSI2

## The Torch Bearer

**Joscha Bach** is the key figure who carried PSI Theory into the new millennium. While Dörner laid the theoretical foundation, Bach built the technical implementation and evolved it into a working cognitive architecture.

### Background

- Computer scientist (not a psychologist like Dörner)
- PhD work focused on implementing PSI as a computational framework
- Former AI researcher at MIT Media Lab, now pursuing independent AGI research
- Active in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community

## Timeline of Development

### Early 2000s: MicroPsi 1.0
- Initial implementation of Dörner's PSI theory
- **The MicroPsi Agent Architecture** (2003) - First major publication
- Used "node nets" (neural-symbolic hybrid representations)
- Connected to virtual environments (3D worlds)

### 2006-2009: Consolidation
- Collaborated directly with Dörner: *"Psi and MicroPsi. A Novel Approach to Modeling Emotion and Cognition in a Cognitive Architecture"* (2006)
- Tutorial at ICCM 2006 with Dörner
- **Principles of Synthetic Intelligence** (book, 2009) - Oxford University Press

### 2012: MicroPsi 2
- Major architectural update: *"MicroPsi 2: The Next Generation of the MicroPsi Framework"* (AGI 2012)
- Evolution from MicroPsi 1 → what Bach sometimes called "PSI2"
- Framework for emergent emotions based on motivation and cognitive modulators
- Presented at the Fifth Conference on Artificial General Intelligence

## Key Contributions

### 1. Technical Implementation
- Built a **working, open-source cognitive architecture**
- Neural-symbolic hybrid representations (combining distributed and localist representations)
- Node-net architecture for knowledge representation

### 2. Cognitive Modulators
Bach refined the "modulator" concept from PSI theory:
- **Arousal** - General activation level
- **Resolution level** - Detail vs. breadth of processing
- **Selection threshold** - How readily the agent switches goals
- **Sampling rate** - Speed of information integration
- **Orienting response** - Attention direction
- **Suppression** - Inhibition of competing processes

### 3. Emergent Emotions
Instead of hard-coding emotions, they emerge from:
- Drive states (hunger, affiliation, curiosity)
- Cognitive modulators
- Goal achievement/failure

This creates "real feelings" that are functionally grounded rather than scripted.

### 4. Seven Principles of Synthetic Intelligence (2008)
Bach distilled PSI into principles for AGI:
1. Agents need drives/urges
2. Cognition serves motivation
3. Emotions are emergent
4. Perception is active/construction-based ("HyPercept")
5. Memory is reconstructive
6. Action is planning-based
7. Learning is continuous

## The Book: Principles of Synthetic Intelligence

Bach's 2009 book remains the definitive technical reference:
- Adapts PSI theory for cognitive science and AI
- Elucidates theoretical and technical frameworks
- Includes implementation details
- Foreword implications: bridges neuroscience, psychology, and AI engineering

**Key Quote:** *"The PSI architecture includes drives and thus directly addresses questions of emotional behavior."*

## Is PSI2 Different From Dörner's Original?

**Yes, but incrementally.**

| Aspect | Original PSI | MicroPsi/PSI2 |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Origin | Psychology | Computer Science |
| Focus | Theory | Implementation |
| Representation | Abstract | Neural-symbolic node nets |
| Environments | 2D microworlds | 3D virtual worlds (Minecraft-like) |
| Emotions | Theoretical framework | Emergent from implementation |
| AGI ambitions | Limited | Explicit |

Bach preserved the core motivational architecture while making it computationally concrete and AGI-oriented.

## Current Status of Joscha Bach

Based on bach.ai publications page:
- Active research through at least 2012
- Publications tail off after 2012
- Later shifted focus toward AGI theory more broadly
- Known for being critical of pure deep learning approaches
- Advocates for architectures with explicit motivation/emotion components

## Frankie's Intuition Check

You were right to feel PSI2 was "for von Neumann machines." Bach is a computer scientist building a **system architecture** — very structured, very modular. Dörner was concerned with **psychological plausibility**. Both valid, different aesthetics.

The question is: Can either approach compete with LLMs that seem to get "motivation" and "emotion" through sheer scale?
