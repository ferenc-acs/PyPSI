# PSI Theory Research Overview

*Research initiated: 2026-02-02*  
*Researcher: Clawd 🦝*

## Executive Summary

This research explores the evolution of Dietrich Dörner's **PSI Theory** ("Psychological Intelligence") from its origins in the 1990s through the present day, with particular focus on modern implementations and the transition to PSI2/MicroPsi frameworks by Joscha Bach.

## What is PSI Theory?

PSI (Ψ) Theory, developed by German psychologist **Dietrich Dörner** at the University of Bamberg in the 1990s, is a cognitive architecture that models human action regulation by integrating:

- **Motivation** (drives/needs that create pressure)
- **Emotion** (affect/emergent from motivation-cognition interactions)
- **Cognition** (planning, perception, memory)

### Core Insight

The theory posits that intelligent behavior emerges from the interaction between:
1. **Demands/Urges** - Basic needs that create motivational pressure
2. **Motives** - Active goals competing for control
3. **Cognitive Modulators** - Parameters that adjust processing style
4. **Affect & Emotions** - Emergent states from the interaction of the above

### Key Distinction from Traditional AI

Unlike goal-directed AI agents that simply optimize objectives, PSI agents have **needs that drain over time** (like hunger, affiliation, curiosity) that create internal pressure. This is much closer to biological intelligence and means the agent's behavior is driven by internal states, not just external goals.

## Research Questions

1. What happened to PSI Theory after Dörner's original work?
2. What is PSI2/MicroPsi and how does it differ?
3. Are there any modern implementations or deployments?
4. Is the architecture still relevant in the LLM era?
