## Research Overview

This research investigates the evolution of **PSI Theory** (Ψ theory), a cognitive architecture developed by Dietrich Dörner in the 1990s, and explores its relevance to modern AI systems.

### Key Questions Addressed
1. What became of PSI Theory in the new millennium?
2. What is PSI2/MicroPsi and how did Joscha Bach evolve the architecture?
3. Are there modern implementations or deployments?
4. Is PSI still relevant in the LLM era?

## Key Findings (TL;DR)

✅ **PSI2/MicroPsi exists and is open source** ([GitHub](https://github.com/joschabach/micropsi2))  
✅ **Joscha Bach preserved and evolved the architecture** (2003-2012)  
✅ **Code runs** - Python 3, web GUI, "active development"  
⚠️ **Small community** - 181 stars on main repo  
⚠️ **Limited recent publications** - Post-2012 activity unclear  
🔥 **Increasingly relevant** - Motivation/emotion gap in LLMs

## The "Von Neumann Machine" Question

Frankie astutely observed that Joscha Bach's implementation feels like it was "built for von Neumann machines" — structured, modular, clean. This is accurate:

| Aspect | Dörner's PSI | Bach's MicroPsi |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Discipline | Psychology | Computer Science |
| Style | Biological, messy | Computational, clean |
| Implementation | Abstract | Concrete, runnable |
| Target | Understanding minds | Building agents |

Both are valid approaches. One captures the *spirit*, the other provides the *tool*.

## Central Insight

**The architecture of needs is still missing from modern AI.**

LLMs have:
- ✅ Knowledge
- ✅ Reasoning
- ✅ Simulation of motivation

But they lack:
- ❌ Intrinsic needs that create pressure
- ❌ Persistent internal state across sessions
- ❌ True autonomy (vs. prompted responses)
- ❌ Emergent emotion from architecture

**PSI addresses exactly these gaps.**
